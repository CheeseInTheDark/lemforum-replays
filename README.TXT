Replays for the lemforum/ community pack, to be replayed in D Lix.

I assume that you will run these replays against the levels in the
most recent beta of D Lix. The replays point to levels in `single/lemforum/',
not to `single/lixlfpack/'. geoo may feel free to change this convention.

Our goal is to achieve 100 % replay coverage.

If you change a level in the community pack, that's okay. You will have to
edit some levels, because not all C++ lemforum levels are solvable in D Lix.
Send me your changed level and a solving replay for your changed level.

Feel free to change levels by other designers. Use your good taste to keep
their spirit and level ideas largely intact.
